        <h1>Our History</h1>
        <h2>The Early Beginnings (17th Century)</h2>
        <p>The earliest history of the Philadelphia Church dates back to the 17th century. Although the exact date is
            unknown, it is known that a log building was built to be used as a place of divine worship. The land on
            which the church was placed was given by Robert Dowling, who came here from Virginia at this time. Robert
            Dowling himself organized the church, which in that day was known as Jeffries Creek Meeting House. According
            to records, this church stood near the site of the Philadelphia Tower. John Dowling, a son of Robert
            Dowling, Abel Stewart, and some of the Parrott family were leaders of the first church, and whose works have
            continued to live after them.</p>

        <h2>The Second Church (1839)</h2>
        <p>In 1839, the Dowlings and Garners united together in the consolidation of a second church, the land of which
            was donated by Simeon Parrott. The trustees included Samuel and William Garner. This area contained two
            acres
            of land in a square situated on the road leading to Darlington Court House between Lake Swamp and Jeffries
            Creek, bounded by the road on one side and Samuel Garner's landline on another, whereupon the church stood.
            The deed states that the land given for the church was to be for free use and all privileges so long as the
            church continued to be kept and held for the Worship of God. If at any time the church should be moved
            to another location, such action would be at the permission of William and Samuel Garner. The deed to this
            church was recorded in 1840. Through the consolidation period just mentioned, the church was no longer
            called Jeffries Creek Meeting House or Dowling's Church, but became known from that time on as Philadelphia
            Church.</p>

        <h2>The Third Church (1910)</h2>
        <p>The next church was moved 1½ miles away from that site, being built only a few yards from where our
            present-day building stands. The deed to the church reads thus: "Know by all men by these, that we, Fannie
            L. Josey,
            and B. S. Josey of the County and State aforesaid, for and in consideration of the love and affection we
            have for the Methodist Episcopal Church, South, and the trust hereinafter mentioned and created and of the
            sum of $1.00 to us paid by the trustees J. C. Clements, C. D. Lee, A. S. Harrel, J. A. Fields, L. W.
            Reddick, W. P. DuBose, J. S. Howle, C. R. Wilson, and P. A. Dowling have granted, bargained, sold and
            released, and by these present do grant bargain, and sell and release unto the said trustees of the
            Darlington Circuit, Methodist Episcopal Church, South, and their successors in office forever: All that
            certain piece, tract, and parcel of land lying, being and situated in the Philadelphia Township --
            containing 1½ acres more or less, bounded as follows: North by Philadelphia church lot and public road, East
            by land of L. B. DuBose and Philadelphia Church lot; South and West by lands of Fannie L. Josey, and B. S.
            Josey." The deed to this land witnessed and sealed 13th day of June, 1910—recorded June 21, 1910.</p>

        <h2>Early Members and Pastors</h2>
        <p>P. A. Dowling and H. A. Dowling were two of Philadelphia's oldest members as of 1940, those two brothers
            having joined in the early part of the church's beginning. H. A. Dowling stated that he joined the church in
            1876 during the pastorate of Rev. L. M. Hamer.</p>
        <br/>
        <p>One of the early clergymen of the church was Rev. Paul Kistler, who served at both the old and new church.
            Other pastors were: Reverends A. T. Hodges, L. M. Hamer, Traywick, Boyd, Jackson, Banks, Clyde,
            J. R. T. Major, Clarkson, Sidney, Beasly, Attaway, Davis, Chewning, Prosser, Shuler, Dunbar, Mitchum,
            Godbold, and others. During the time Rev. Banks preached at this place. His son, Luther Banks, who was a
            member at Philadelphia, felt the call to preach. He accepted and went out as a preacher from this
            church.</p>
        <br/>
        <p>Outstanding members of the early Philadelphia Church included: Reuben Hay, R. P. Howle, George Byrd, Fuller
            Howle, William Stewart (who served as Steward and Superintendent), Samuel Dowling (who served as a local
            preacher), Hattie DuBose (Supt. and Steward).</p>

        <h2>The Southern Methodist Church (1939)</h2>
        <p>The membership in 1938 was 78 and grew to 195 in 1940. Philadelphia Church, along with a number of churches
            and groups in South Carolina, refused to enter the merger of 1939 of the Methodist Episcopal Church, the
            Methodist Episcopal Church, South, and the Methodist Protestant Church, and banded together to form the
            Southern Methodist Church. Deed for the present church property was received in 1941 giving the congregation
            of the Philadelphia Southern Methodist control of their property.</p>

        <p>The first Southern Methodist pastor was Rev. Harper. During his pastorate, J. S. Meggs, a member of the
            Philadelphia Southern Methodist Church, entered the ministry and became the second man to go out from this
            church into God's Work. Ministers following Rev. Harper were: Reverends Crawford, Shealy, Rocquemore,
            Hartley, Pullin, Howard, Lloyd, Huggins, Barbee, English, Meyers, Hutto, Lancaster, and Stephenson. Young
            men recently entering the Gospel Ministry from Philadelphia Church are: Tad Windham, and Bill Friar.</p>

        <h2>Recent Developments</h2>
        <p>In 1949 a beautifully landscaped Cemetery was built and has been used by many families in the church and
            community.</p>

        <p>A lovely and spacious asbestos-siding parsonage was completed in 1952. Renovation was done on the parsonage
            in 1967, making it more modern and convenient.</p>

        <p>During 1963–64 the congregation constructed a nice Educational Building of concrete block. The
            Building Committee was: Mr. Bernice Yarborough, Chairman, Mr. Loran Watford, Mr. Dan Dowling, Mr. Clifton
            Galloway, and Mr. L. A. Tallon.</p>

        <p>In the Summer of 1968, Philadelphia Church sanctuary was remodeled. This involved changing the arch enclosing
            the pulpit and choir, constructing a new and larger altar, painting, carpeting, lighting, heating, and
            air-conditioning. The pews and pulpit furniture were also refinished. While the work was being done the
            congregation met in the Educational Building.
            In 1970 the Sunday School rooms in the rear of the church were
            remodeled, making them roomier and nicer.</p>

        <h2>Philadelphia SMC Today</h2>
        <p>Today, in April, 1972, Philadelphia Church has an active church roll of 126 members, with an inactive roll of
            85. The present property is valued as follows: Church—$30,000.00; parsonage—$15,000.00; and Educational
            Building—$5,000.00.</p>

        <p>Although many faithful members of this church have gone to be with the Lord, and the church has passed
            through many challenges and problems, God has preserved it for a very special purpose: the task of winning
            lost souls to Jesus Christ.</p>

        <p>We have a beautiful church; may we rejoice in knowing that all efforts put forth have not been in
            vain...knowing that God says His Word will not return unto Him void.</p>
