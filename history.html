        <h2>Our History</h2>
        <p>
            Philadelphia Southern Methodist Church meets in a beautiful 100+ year-old church building at 1665 Philadelphia Street in lower Darlington County. The question often comes up: who are these "Southern" Methodists and how are they different from United Methodists?
            <br /><br />
            To answer that question, one must go back to a time before the United States of America was establishedâ€”back to 1739 when John Wesley established his Methodist Societies, first in Europe, then in the American colonies. From these societies the Methodist Church was born.

        <h3>Historical Background</h3>
        <p>
            But in the mid 1800's, as a result of political & social differences, the church divided into the Methodist Episcopal Church, North and the Methodist Episcopal Church, South. In 1938, encouraged by the Bishops, it was decided that the Methodist Church, North and South would join together to form a unified church called the United Methodist Church.
            <br /><br />
            However, there were a significant number of churches in the old Methodist Episcopal Church, South that refused to enter into the united church fearing that the new unified church would result in modernistic tendencies and theological liberalism! As a result, an organization for the preservation of the Methodist Episcopal Church, South, was formed. Since the courts granted the unified church the rights to the name Methodist Episcopal Church, South, the old Methodist Episcopal Church, South, came to be known as The Southern Methodist Church.
