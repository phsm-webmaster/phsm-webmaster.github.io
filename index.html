        <h2>Welcome to Philadelphia Southern Methodist Church</h2>

        <p>Nestled in the heart of Darlington County, our beautiful 100+ year-old church at 1665 Philadelphia Street
            stands as a testament to our enduring faith and traditions.
            We are a community dedicated to preserving the
            authentic beliefs and practices of the Methodist Episcopal Church, South.</p>

        <h3>Our Heritage</h3>
        <p>As faithful remnants of the Old Southern Methodist Episcopal Church, we proudly maintain the doctrinal and
            theological beliefs that have been the cornerstone of our faith since before 1938.
            Our roots trace back to
            John Wesley's Methodist Societies of 1739, and we continue to uphold these time-honored traditions.</p>

        <h3>Our Beliefs</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>We hold the Holy Bible as the entirely Divinely inspired Word of God</li>
            <li>We believe in the sanctity of marriage between a man and a woman</li>
            <li>We accept the Biblical account of creation</li>
            <li>We believe in the virgin birth, death, burial, and resurrection of our Lord Jesus Christ</li>
            <li>We await His return to redeem those who have remained true to His Name</li>
        </ul>

            <p>"If your parents or grandparents worshiped in a Methodist Church prior to 1938, their religious beliefs
                were undoubtedly the same as those held today by the Southern Methodist Church." — Rev. Dr. L. Darwin
